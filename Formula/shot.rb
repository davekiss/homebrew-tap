  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Register shot as an MCP server in your agent, e.g.:
        codex mcp add shot -- shot
        claude mcp add --scope user shot -- shot

      To give Codex or OpenCode the shot skill:
        mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
        ln -s #{opt_pkgshare}/skills/screenshots ~/.agents/skills/screenshots

      Capturing needs Screen Recording permission for the app that runs your
      agent: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording.
